    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm an enthusiastic and curious learner with a deep interest in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Full Stack Web Development.
      I love building things that combine creativity with logic—from dynamic web applications to intelligent systems that learn and adapt.
      Currently, I'm exploring how data can be transformed into insights and how scalable, user-friendly applications can bring ideas to life. 
      Whether it's front-end design, back-end logic, or machine learning models, I'm constantly learning and leveling up my skills.
      I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with code and always looking for opportunities to grow, collaborate, and innovate.
