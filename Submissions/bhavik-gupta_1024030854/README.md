# 🌐 Personal Portfolio – Bhavik Gupta (1024030854)

Hey! 👋  
This is my submission for the Tech Task Round of **ECHOES – The Media Club of Thapar**. I’ve built a one-page personal landing site that gives a glimpse into who I am and what I enjoy building.

## 🌟 Why I Designed It This Way

Honestly, I didn’t want to overdo things. I kept it simple, clean, and close to how I personally like websites to feel — no chaos, no unnecessary noise. Just smooth scrolling, readable fonts, and a layout that flows naturally.  

I took some inspiration from portfolios I’ve seen online but made sure to add my own structure and tweaks so it feels like *me*. Everything is from scratch, nothing copied. I wanted this page to feel personal — like a little digital introduction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used

I stuck to the basics but tried to use them creatively:

- **HTML** – for building the structure  
- **CSS** – for styling, layout and responsiveness (used Flexbox a lot)  
- **JavaScript** – for simple animations and interactivity  
- **Font Awesome** – for icons  
- **Google Fonts** – for typography  
- **Responsive Design** – because mobile > everything 😄

## ✨ What’s on the Page?

- A short **About Me** section (yep, I talk about myself a little)
- A clean **Skills** section with icons and labels
- A basic **Projects** section to show a few things I’ve worked on
- **Contact section** with my GitHub/LinkedIn
- Some transitions and animations to keep it alive

I didn’t want it to look like a resume. Instead, I wanted something that speaks more about my vibe — how I like to keep things simple but functional.

## 🎯 Why I Made It Like This

My main goal was to build something that looks clean and tells my story in under a minute. Not too flashy, not too dull — just enough to show that I can build a neat front-end page with a bit of personality.  

It’s not perfect — and that’s fine. I’m still learning, but this was fun to make, and I hope it gives you a good sense of who I am, not just as a developer but as a person who enjoys creating.

## 📝 Final Note

This was built from scratch without using any pre-made templates or generators.  
If something feels off — it’s mine 😅  
If something feels nice — still mine 😎

Thanks for checking it out!
