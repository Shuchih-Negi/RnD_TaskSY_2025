## ✨ Task Overview

The objective of this task was to create a **one-page creative personal landing webpage** that reflects my personality, interests, and technical flair. I approached this as a chance to showcase both my design sensibilities and front-end web development skills.

## 🎨 Design Inspiration


I wanted the page to feel clean yet expressive, much like an interactive journal. I drew inspiration from minimalist portfolio designs and added a personal twist with warm color tones and soft typography. The layout mirrors a storytelling format to introduce who I am step-by-step.
